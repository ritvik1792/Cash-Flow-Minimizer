# Cash-Flow-Minimizer

# Cash Flow Minimization Problem This repository contains a C++ implementation of the cash flow minimization problem. 
The code aims to solve the problem efficiently and accurately. 
## Problem Description 
The cash flow minimization problem involves finding the minimum number of transactions required to balance the cash flow among a group of individuals 
or entities. Each individual or entity has a certain amount of money that they owe or are owed by others. The goal is to minimize the total number of 
transactions needed to settle all debts. 

In a scenario where multiple banks have debts and credits with each other, it is necessary to find the minimum number of transactions needed to settle all
the outstanding amounts. Each bank may have different payment modes, which adds complexity to the problem. ## Objective The objective is to minimize the 
number of transactions required to settle all the debts and credits among the banks. ## Approach To solve this problem, we need to analyze the debts and 
credits of each bank and find the optimal way to settle them. This can be done by identifying the banks with the highest debts and the banks with the 
highest credits. By matching these banks, we can minimize the number of transactions needed. 

# Minimum Transactions for Debt Settlement 
This problem deals with finding the minimum number of transactions required to settle the debts and credits among multiple banks with different payment modes.


## Algorithm 
1. Calculate the total debts and credits for each bank.
2. Identify the bank with the highest debt and the bank
   

## Input 
The program expects the following inputs from the user:
1. Number of banks: The user should provide the total number of banks involved in the transactions.
2. Bank details: For each bank, the user needs to provide the name and payment modes.
3. Transaction details: The user should input the debtor bank, creditor bank, and the amount for each transaction.



# Bank Class 
The program utilizes a Bank class to represent each bank. This class stores the bank's name, net amount, and available payment modes. 


## Minimize Cash Flow 
The `minimizeCashFlow` function is designed to iteratively find and settle transactions until all banks have a net amount of zero. 
This function is useful in scenarios where there are multiple banks involved in financial transactions and the goal is to minimize the overall cash flow.
The algorithm works by identifying the bank with the maximum net amount and the bank with the minimum net amount. It then settles a transaction between 
these two banks, reducing the net amount for both banks. This process is repeated until all banks have a net amount of zero. By minimizing the cash flow, 
this function helps to simplify financial transactions and ensure that all banks involved have an equal net amount. This can be particularly useful in 
scenarios where there are complex financial relationships between multiple parties. 


The cash flow minimization problem involves finding the most efficient way to allocate cash flows among a set of entities in order to minimize the overall
cash flow. The goal is to minimize the amount of cash that needs to be transferred between entities while ensuring that all entities have sufficient
funds to meet their obligations. ## Solution The code provides a solution to the cash flow minimization problem by implementing an algorithm that optimally 
allocates cash flows among entities. It takes into account the current cash balances of each entity and the obligations they need to fulfill. The algorithm 
works by iteratively identifying the entities with the highest positive and negative cash imbalances. It then transfers funds between these entities
